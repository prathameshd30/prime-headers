# Prime Headers
## Header-only, type-safe, generic data structures and algorithms for C.

Prime Headers is a headers-only, easy to use, strongly typed way to use generic data structures and algorithms in C Projects.

It works primarily by abusing the C preprocessor to a scale hitherto undreamt of.

### Data structures implemented

- [ ] Vector
- [x] Stack using Vector
- [] Stack using Linked List
- [] Stack using 2 Queues
- [] Queue using Vector
- [] Queue using Linked List
- [] Deque (Double Ended Queue) using Vector
- [] Deque (Double Ended Queue) using Linked List
- [x] Singly Linked List
- [] Circular Singly Linked List
- [] Doubly Linked List
- [] Circular Doubly Linked List
- [] Generalized Linked List
- [] Binary Tree
- [] Binary Search Tree
- [] AVL Tree
- [] RB Tree

### Algorithms implemented

- [] Linear Search
- [] Binary Search
- [] Bubble Sort
- [] Insertion Sort
- [] Merge Sort
- [] Quick sort


### Pros

1. Relatively easy use of generic data structures and algorithms while being type-safe.
2. Is cool, I mean what is cooler than preprocessor hijinks.

### Cons

1. This method is optimised for ease of use, however, defining multiple data structures in the same file may lead to **slower compilation times** due to large compilation units because of the coupling of interfaces (headers & prototypes) and the actual functionality (function definitions) itself.
2. **Poor support** (slow) for Intellisense and similar code intelligence tools.

> This project is a side-effect of trying to develop a command-line tool for easier use of generic data structures, which splits the interface and the function definitions, leading to better compilation times.


## Some helpful projects which helped me develop this

Thought this was an original idea, but this repository I found later implemented this already - https://github.com/mystborn/GenericDataStructures

I got the idea for the need of type-safe data structures by seeing this repository, otherwise it is perfect, especially the error handling is **chef's kiss** - https://github.com/MostafaTwfiq/C-DataStructures-And-Algorithms
